# Automated-Time-table-scheduling-for-IIIT-Dharwad
• Create a software solution that efficiently schedules lectures, tutorials, and lab sessions for
various departments, batches , faculty, and classrooms.

• The primary objective of this project is to automate the generation of the academic
timetable for the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Dharwad. The manual
process of creating a feasible timetable is complex, time-consuming, and prone to human
error. This project aims to create a software solution that efficiently schedules lectures,
tutorials, and lab sessions for various departments, batches, faculty, and classrooms.

• The system will address the complexities arising from elective courses and faculty avail-
ability preferences. By automating this process, the project seeks to reduce administrative

effort and improve the overall quality, fairness, and adaptability of the academic schedule
at IIIT Dharwad.
